    <p>Welcome to your life <br>
      There's no turning back <br>
      Even while we sleep<br>
      We will find you<br>
      <br>
      Acting on your best behavior<br>
      Turn your back on Mother Nature<br>
      Everybody wants to rule the world<br>
      <br>
      It's my own design<br>
      It's my own remorse<br>
      Help me to decide<br>
      Help me make the<br>
      <br>
      Most of freedom and of pleasure<br>
      Nothing ever lasts forever<br>
      Everybody wants to rule the world<br>
      <br>
      There's a room where the light won't find you<br>
      Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down<br>
      When they do, I'll be right behind you<br>
      <br>
      So glad we've almost made it<br>
      So sad they had to fade it<br>
      Everybody wants to rule the world<br>
      <br>
      I can't stand this indecision<br>
      Married with a lack of vision<br>
      Everybody wants to rule the world<br>
      <br>
      Say that you'll never never never never need it<br>
      One headline, why believe it?<br>
      Everybody wants to rule the world<br>
      <br>
      All for freedom and for pleasure<br>
      Nothing ever lasts forever<br>
      Everybody wants to rule the world<br>
    </p>
